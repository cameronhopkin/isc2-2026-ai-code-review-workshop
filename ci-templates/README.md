# Run the bot on your pull requests

Module 4. The bot reviews only the lines a pull request or merge request changes and posts one comment. It edits that comment on later pushes instead of adding new ones. It never blocks the merge.

The model runs inside the free CI runner. No API keys and no cloud model. The first run downloads the model (about 6.6 GB). Later runs restore it from the CI cache.

**Expect about 8 minutes per pull request.** Measured on a free GitHub runner in October 2026 on the lab change below: about 1 minute to install Ollama, about 6 minutes for the review itself (the runner has no GPU, so the model runs on CPU), and seconds to post. Because the check never blocks the merge, nobody waits on it.

Pick GitHub or GitLab. You do not need both.

## Before you start

You need your own copy of this repository on GitHub or GitLab.

- **GitHub:** create a new **public** repository and push this repository to it. It must be public: GitHub's free runners for public repositories have 16 GB of memory, which the model needs, while private repositories get 7 GB. Everything in this repository is deliberately vulnerable demo code, so it is safe to publish.
- **GitLab:** create a new project and push this repository to it. Public or private both work.

```bash
git remote add mine <your-repository-url>
git push mine HEAD:main
```

```powershell
git remote add mine <your-repository-url>
git push mine HEAD:main
```

## GitHub Actions

1. Copy the workflow into place on `main` and push it:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   cp ci-templates/github/security-review.yml .github/workflows/
   git add .github/workflows/security-review.yml
   git commit -m "Add the security review bot"
   git push mine HEAD:main
   ```

   ```powershell
   New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force .github/workflows | Out-Null
   Copy-Item ci-templates/github/security-review.yml .github/workflows/
   git add .github/workflows/security-review.yml
   git commit -m "Add the security review bot"
   git push mine HEAD:main
   ```

2. Open a pull request with the lab change (see "The lab change" below).
3. Watch the **Actions** tab. When the job finishes, the bot's comment appears on the pull request.

Nothing else to set up. The workflow uses the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## GitLab CI/CD

1. Create the token the bot comments with. GitLab's built-in job token cannot comment on merge requests.
   - **Settings > Access tokens > Add new token.** Name it `review-bot`, role **Reporter**, scope **api**, and an expiry date after the workshop.
   - Copy the token.
   - **Settings > CI/CD > Variables > Add variable.** Key `REVIEW_BOT_TOKEN`, paste the token, tick **Mask variable**.
2. Copy the pipeline into place on `main` and push it:

   ```bash
   cp ci-templates/gitlab/security-review.gitlab-ci.yml .gitlab-ci.yml
   git add .gitlab-ci.yml
   git commit -m "Add the security review bot"
   git push mine HEAD:main
   ```

   ```powershell
   Copy-Item ci-templates/gitlab/security-review.gitlab-ci.yml .gitlab-ci.yml
   git add .gitlab-ci.yml
   git commit -m "Add the security review bot"
   git push mine HEAD:main
   ```

3. Open a merge request with the lab change (see below).
4. Watch **Build > Pipelines**. When the job finishes, the bot's comment appears on the merge request.

The pipeline asks for GitLab's medium runner, because the default model needs more memory than the small one has. The medium runner uses your free compute minutes faster. If it is not available to you, delete the `tags` lines and set the variables `REVIEW_MODEL` to `qwen2.5-coder:7b` and `REVIEW_THINK` to `false`.

## The lab change

`lab/add-order-importer.patch` adds a small, plausible feature with three real bugs in it. Apply it on a new branch and open a pull or merge request from that branch:

```bash
git switch -c add-order-importer
git apply ci-templates/lab/add-order-importer.patch
git add target-app/importer.py
git commit -m "Add bulk order import"
git push mine add-order-importer
```

```powershell
git switch -c add-order-importer
git apply ci-templates/lab/add-order-importer.patch
git add target-app/importer.py
git commit -m "Add bulk order import"
git push mine add-order-importer
```

Then open the pull or merge request from `add-order-importer` into `main` in the web interface.

Do not read the patch before the bot has reviewed it. Compare the bot's comment with what you find yourself afterwards.

## If something goes wrong

- **No comment appears, GitHub.** Open the job log. If it says the token lacks permission, check that the workflow file still has `pull-requests: write` under `permissions`.
- **No comment appears, GitLab.** The job log names the problem. Most often `REVIEW_BOT_TOKEN` is missing, not masked correctly, or the token's role is below Reporter.
- **The job runs out of time or memory.** Use the smaller model: set `REVIEW_MODEL` to `qwen2.5-coder:7b` and `REVIEW_THINK` to `false` (GitHub: repository variables; GitLab: CI/CD variables).
- **The comment says no findings.** The diff contained no Python files, or the scanners found nothing on the changed lines. The comment says which.
