"""Smoke test for the review pipeline.

Runs review.py against target-app and checks that the output is valid
JSON, conforms to the findings schema, and reports the three planted bugs
that Phase 1 can actually reach.

  python smoke.py            full run, needs Ollama and the model
  python smoke.py --dry-run  renders the prompts only, no model needed

The dry run is what CI uses, because CI runners have no model.
